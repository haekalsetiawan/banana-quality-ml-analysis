# Banana Quality Analysis

This project is a machine learning-based analysis for predicting the quality of bananas. Using features such as size, weight, sweetness, softness, and more, the model predicts whether a banana is of "Good" or "Bad" quality.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned, normalized, and split into features and target.
2. **Model Training**: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the processed data.
3. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated based on accuracy and precision using metrics like classification report.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/banana_quality_analysis.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd banana_quality_analysis

3. Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the project:
python main.py

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 97% in predicting banana quality, with strong performance in both "Good" and "Bad" categories.
